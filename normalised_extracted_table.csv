Review Engagement Financial Statements,,,,
"We have audited the accompanying financial statements of [Company Name], which comprise the",,,,
"balance sheet as of [date], and the related statements of income, changes in equity, and cash flows",,,,
"for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements.",,,,
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements,,,,
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in,,,,
"accordance with [applicable financial reporting framework], and for such internal control as",,,,
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free,,,,
"from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.",,,,
Auditor's Responsibility,,,,
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We,,,,
"conducted our audit in accordance with [applicable auditing standards], which require that we comply",,,,
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about,,,,
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.,,,,
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures,,,,
"in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the",,,,
"assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or",,,,
"error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's",,,,
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that,,,,
"are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the",,,,
effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of,,,,
"accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as",,,,
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.,,,,
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis,,,,
for our audit opinion.,,,,
Opinion,,,,
We qualify the treatmemnt of preferred shares. Qualification for the treatment of preference shares is,,,,
because the recent regulation requires preference shares to be treated as a loan whereas the,,,,
company has treated this as equity,,,,
